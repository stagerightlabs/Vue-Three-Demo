# vue-threejs-demo

This is a Proof-Of-Concept integration of Vue.js and Three.js. I have converted the Three.js [Trackball Control Example](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=cont#misc_controls_trackball) to a Vue/Vuex application and added some additional UI sugar on top.

[See the demo here](https://vuethree.stagerightlabs.com/)
